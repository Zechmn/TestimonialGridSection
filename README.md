# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture

**HTML Structure**: The project uses semantic HTML5 with `<article>` elements for each testimonial card, ensuring proper accessibility and SEO structure. Each testimonial contains a header section with avatar and author information, followed by quote and content sections.

**CSS Architecture**: Employs a component-based CSS approach with BEM-like naming conventions (`testimonial__header`, `testimonial__avatar`, etc.). The styling is organized with:
- Reset styles for cross-browser consistency
- CSS Grid for the main layout container
- Flexbox for individual component alignment
- CSS custom properties (HSL color values) for consistent theming
- Responsive design using media queries

**Layout System**: Uses CSS Grid as the primary layout mechanism with a single-column mobile-first approach that scales up to multi-column layouts on larger screens. The grid system provides flexible positioning of testimonial cards.

**Typography**: Integrates Google Fonts (Barlow Semi Condensed) with fallback system fonts. Typography scale is carefully defined with consistent font weights (500, 600) and sizing.

**Interactive Elements**: Implements subtle hover effects on testimonial cards using CSS transforms and box-shadow transitions to enhance user experience.

## Design System

**Color Palette**: Follows a systematic approach using HSL color values for primary (purple tones), neutral (grays and whites), and semantic colors. This ensures consistent theming and easy maintenance.

**Spacing System**: Uses consistent spacing units (24px, 16px) throughout the design for margins, padding, and gaps, creating visual rhythm and hierarchy.

**Component Design**: Each testimonial card is designed as a reusable component with consistent internal structure, making it easy to add or modify testimonials.
