HTML Feedback (`index.html`)
	•	Line 1-7 (Doctype–Meta/Title): All foundational tags are correctly included. Improvement: For accessibility, ensure the `<html>` `lang` attribute (e.g. `lang="en"`) is set.
	•	Line 8-15 (Font & Stylesheets): Font imports for ‘Barlow Semi Condensed’ and stylesheet includes are correct and match the design font.
	•	Main section `main class="testimonials-grid"`: Proper main wrapper used for semantic structure. Improvement: Consider using `<section>` instead of `<main>` if this isn’t the main content of the page.
	•	Individual testimonial `article class="testimonial testimonial--daniel"` and others: Each testimonial uses an `article` (semantic), with BEM-like modifier classes for variants (e.g., `testimonial--daniel`). All testimonial elements have their own sub-structure (header, avatar, author info, quote, content), which is good for maintainability.
	•	Avatar `<img>` tags: Correct use of `alt` attributes (with names). Improvement: Optimize `alt` text for screen readers (e.g., `alt="Photo of Daniel Clifford"`).
	•	Testimonial quote and content structure: Uses `h2` for prominent quote, but there are repeated `h2`s in each card with similar semantics. Improvement: Consider whether a `<blockquote>` with a `<p>` and a visually hidden heading (or `h3`) would be better for accessibility, to avoid “heading spam”.
	•	Structure hierarchy and semantics: The nesting and order match the provided designs. Cards are grouped together, and each person’s testimonial is isolated and labeled. Improvement: Add `aria-label` or visually hidden headings for screen readers for better accessibility and navigation.
CSS Feedback (`styles.css`)
	•	Reset styles: Good use of `* { box-sizing: border-box; }`. Resets margins and paddings globally. Improvement: Consider resetting more elements for robust cross-browser consistency.
	•	Body/base styles: Uses the correct imported font-family, background, primary font color, vertical/horizontal centering, minimum viewport height, and padding. This matches the clean look of the design. Font size and spacing follow the design closely.
	•	Grid container `.testimonials-grid`: Has `max-width`, centered with `margin: auto`, and uses CSS Grid, which is excellent for responsive layouts. Matches the layout behavior in both mobile and desktop designs, utilizing column/row spans and gaps.
	•	Card styles `.testimonial`: Cards are rounded with `border-radius`, padded, and have a subtle shadow. Improvement: Compare border radius and shadow sharpness to the Figma/PSD reference for exactness.
	•	Card hover/active: Has a hover state with elevation via transform/shadow, which provides interactivity (not visible in static designs but good practice).
	•	Header (`.testimonial__header`) styles: Uses flex to align avatar and author info horizontally with adequate gap and spacing.
	•	Avatar and author styling: Avatar size, border radius, and color overlays for each testimonial are set with subclass selectors, correctly following the colored border theme in the design.
	•	Quote (`.testimonial__quote`) and content (`.testimonial__content`) styles: Font sizes, line heights, and font weights seem to match design fidelity.
	•	Testimonial variants: Each testimonial uses a modifier class for unique background and text colors. The use of specific HSL values for purple, blue, dark, and white backgrounds aligns with the reference images.
	•	.testimonial–daniel::before pseudo-element: Implements the decorative quote SVG overlay as seen in the hero purple card. Improvement: Ensure the SVG path and position match pixel-perfectly with the design mockup – sometimes paddings or alignment may need manual tweaks.
	•	Grid responsiveness with media queries: Uses breakpoints at `375px` (mobile), `768px` (tablet), `1024px` (desktop), and `1440px` (large desktop) to progressively increase the grid column count and arrange testimonial spanning. These breakpoints and column setups (2-column for tablet, 4x2 grid for desktop with special placements) successfully mimic the desktop design.
	•	Extra feedback: Some class names in CSS like `.testimonial__header`, `.testimonial__avatar`, etc., use BEM-convention but HTML uses classes like `testimonialheader` and `testimonialavatar`. This could cause styling mismatches. Improvement: Check if the CSS and HTML class names are consistent (e.g., `testimonialheader` in HTML vs `.testimonial__header` in CSS). If inconsistent, either update HTML or CSS so selectors apply as intended.
